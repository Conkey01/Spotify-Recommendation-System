# Spotify-Recommendation-System
I built a hybrid Spotify music recommendation system!

I included a function that calculates the cosine similarity scores between the input songs features to identify the most similar songs.

I then extended the content-based recommendations by incorporating a weighted popularity factor based on the release date of the song.

The hybrid recommendations are sorted based on the weighted popularity score in descending order.

The recommendations are then outputted depending on the input song, I inputted a test song of Iâ€™m Good (Blue).

Iv'e included a lot of comments to explain the whole process!
